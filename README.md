# TagStudier

A cli app to extend [TagStudio's](https://docs.tagstud.io/) capacities

This is a **alpha** app. Tests are inexistents, things move fast and break, make backups of your database file!

# Usage

Open your terminal into your tagstudio folder, and run the app.

To use the Pixiv commands, you need to add a `tagerine_config.json` file in `.TagStudio`

```json
{
    "pixiv_cookies": "<Your pixiv cookies>"
}
```
